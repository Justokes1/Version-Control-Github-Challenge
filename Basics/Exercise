Explain the Terminal in your own words:

The terminal is used to traverse your computer without a Graphical User interface. You can manage, create, and delete directories & files. You can also use your terminal to code efficiently and reduce mouse usage.

What is the difference between Git & Github?

Github is used to host repositories in a cloud-based system, while Git is used for version control and can be used locally.

Why do we use Github?

When working in a team, Github is vital to making sure there are no conflicts when working in a big team. This is done by "checking out" your own instance of an application to edit locally. You can do this without inferring with someone else's work or compromising the security of your application.
